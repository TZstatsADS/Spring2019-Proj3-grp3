Seungwook Han
* Brainstormed and researched on deep learning-based models that we can use for the super resolution task
* Tried to implement a deep CNN model for the super resolution task (https://github.com/jiny2001/dcscn-super-resolution/)
* Explored and implemented different options for improving the xgboost model by changing and optimizing the parameters (max_depth, nrounds, booster, etc)
* Researched new datasets that we could use as a validation set to ensure the performance of our improved model
